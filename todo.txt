√ use blob functions on resize instead of read/delete/write
- encryption of the data
- prune old data when cache grows too big
- Save maxSize somehow

	- What happens if we're writing a partial and cache suddenly needs to be
	  pruned because a big object is being added? possibility: never prune

	- what was my old api for partials? why did I abandon it?
	- why is my sqlite c++ wrapper so C-ish? (e g SQLITE_ROW)
	- why sqlite and not a file store + hash table?
		- did I actually win anything with sqlite?
- make sure everything's properly documented (perhaps doxygen it)
