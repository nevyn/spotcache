√ encryption of the data
- Save maxSize somehow
- windows port
- Performance graphs when all the rest is done.
√ write design rationale
	√ what was my old api for partials? why did I abandon it?
	√ why is my sqlite c++ wrapper so C-ish? (e g SQLITE_ROW)
	√ why sqlite and not a file store + hash table?
		X did I actually win anything with sqlite?
√ make sure everything's properly documented (perhaps doxygen it)

√ use blob functions on resize instead of read/delete/write
√ prune old data when cache grows too big
√ Partials need to be rethought
	√ Use an object to represent a partial?
	√ What happens if we're writing a partial and cache suddenly needs to be
	  pruned because a big object is being added? possibility: never prune
		partials.
